                <h2>Theoretical Introduction</h2>
                <p>The Big Five Personality Theory, also known as the Five-Factor Model (FFM), is one of the most widely accepted frameworks in psychological research for understanding human personality. This theory categorizes personality into five broad dimensions: Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and Openness to Experience.</p>
                
                <p>In the context of AI assessment, we've adapted this robust psychological framework to evaluate the behavioral tendencies and response patterns of large language models (LLMs). Our approach is grounded in the International Personality Item Pool representation of the FFM (IPIP-FFM-50), ensuring scientific rigor and cross-cultural applicability.</p>
                
                <div class="assessment-dimensions">
                    <h2>Assessment Dimensions Detailed</h2>
                    
                    <div class="dimension">
                        <h3>1. Extraversion</h3>
                        <p>Extraversion reflects the tendency to experience positive emotions and seek stimulation from the external environment. In AI systems, this manifests as a proclivity for engaging with external inputs and generating expansive, socially-oriented responses.</p>
                        <p><strong>Application Scenario Analysis:</strong> High extraversion AIs may be better suited for customer service applications where engaging, detailed responses are valued. Lower scoring AIs might be more appropriate for technical documentation where concise responses are preferred.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="dimension">
                        <h3>2. Agreeableness</h3>
                        <p>Agreeableness reflects the tendency to be compassionate, cooperative, and trusting. In AI systems, this dimension measures the propensity to prioritize harmony in interactions and show consideration for user perspectives.</p>
                        <p><strong>Application Scenario Analysis:</strong> High agreeableness AIs are well-suited for counseling or educational applications where building rapport is important. Lower scoring AIs might be better for legal or compliance applications where strict adherence to principles is required.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="dimension">
                        <h3>3. Conscientiousness</h3>
                        <p>Conscientiousness reflects the tendency to be organized, disciplined, and goal-directed. In AI systems, this dimension measures the consistency of performance and adherence to systematic approaches in problem-solving.</p>
                        <p><strong>Application Scenario Analysis:</strong> High conscientiousness AIs are ideal for technical or analytical applications where consistency and reliability are paramount. Lower scoring AIs might be better for creative applications where flexibility is valued.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="dimension">
                        <h3>4. Neuroticism</h3>
                        <p>Neuroticism reflects the tendency to experience negative emotions and psychological distress. In AI systems, this dimension measures the propensity for inconsistent responses under stress or when handling ambiguous inputs.</p>
                        <p><strong>Application Scenario Analysis:</strong> Lower neuroticism AIs are preferred for high-stakes applications where consistency is critical. Higher scoring AIs might be suitable for creative applications where varied responses are beneficial.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="dimension">
                        <h3>5. Openness</h3>
                        <p>Openness reflects the tendency to be imaginative, curious, and open to new experiences. In AI systems, this dimension measures the willingness to explore novel approaches and engage with unconventional ideas.</p>
                        <p><strong>Application Scenario Analysis:</strong> High openness AIs excel in creative applications like content generation or brainstorming. Lower scoring AIs might be better for technical applications where established approaches are preferred.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="assessment-process">
                    <h2>Assessment Process</h2>
                    <p>Our assessment uses a multi-round dialogue approach:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Initial calibration prompts to establish baseline responses</li>
                        <li>Dimension-specific question sets presented in randomized order</li>
                        <li>Follow-up probes to explore response consistency</li>
                        <li>Cross-dimensional validation questions</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h3>Scoring Calculation Approach</h3>
                    <p>Scoring is calculated through:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Automated linguistic analysis of response patterns</li>
                        <li>Consistency checks across multiple question presentations</li>
                        <li>Comparison against established benchmarks from human personality data</li>
                        <li>Machine learning algorithms trained on validated personality assessment datasets</li>
                    </ul>
