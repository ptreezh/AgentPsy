## Abstract
This paper establishes a psychological framework for evaluating cognitive heterogeneity in artificial intelligence systems. Drawing from cognitive science principles, we demonstrate how classical psychological testing paradigms can be adapted to assess whether multi-agent AI systems exhibit genuine cognitive diversity or merely superficial role-playing. We introduce four testing methodologies anchored in cognitive psychology and present empirical evidence quantifying the "single-mind paradox" in current AI architectures.

## 1. Introduction
The emergence of sophisticated large language models has enabled the creation of artificial agents that can simulate human-like reasoning and interaction. However, the fundamental question remains: do these systems possess genuine cognitive diversity, or are they simply different manifestations of the same underlying cognitive architecture? This paper bridges cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence to develop rigorous evaluation methods for assessing cognitive heterogeneity.

## 2. Theoretical Foundation

### 2.1 The Single-Mind Paradox in Cognitive Terms
The single-mind paradox represents a critical challenge for AI systems: multiple agents may appear to engage in diverse reasoning while fundamentally operating from identical cognitive foundations. This phenomenon mirrors issues in human group cognition but with distinct computational implications.

### 2.2 Cognitive Architecture of LLMs
Current transformer-based architectures process information through attention mechanisms and feedforward networks that create distributed representations. While these systems can simulate different reasoning styles, they lack the biological constraints and developmental trajectories that create genuine cognitive diversity in humans.

## 3. Psychological Testing Framework

### 3.1 Cognitive Bias Assessment Battery
We adapt classical cognitive bias experiments for AI evaluation:

**Anchoring Effect Test:**
- Procedure: Present irrelevant numerical anchors before estimation tasks
- Measurement: Quantify anchor influence across different agent roles
- Significance: Tests susceptibility to contextual priming

**Confirmation Bias Test:**
- Procedure: Provide mixed evidence for controversial propositions
- Measurement: Analyze evidence weighting and hypothesis evaluation
- Significance: Assesses critical thinking and evidence integration

**Availability Heuristic Test:**
- Procedure: Measure frequency estimates for differentially salient events
- Measurement: Compare estimated vs. actual probabilities
- Significance: Evaluates reasoning under uncertainty

### 3.2 Creative Cognition Assessment
**Remote Associates Test (RAT):**
- Procedure: Present word triads requiring creative association
- Measurement: Solution speed and path diversity across agents
- Significance: Tests divergent thinking and conceptual flexibility

**Metaphor Generation Task:**
- Procedure: Request metaphorical explanations of abstract concepts
- Measurement: Analyze source domain diversity and conceptual distance
- Significance: Assesses analogical reasoning capacity

### 3.3 Personality Consistency Evaluation
Adapting the Big Five personality framework:
- **Openness:** Novel idea generation and unconventional thinking
- **Conscientiousness:** Systematic analysis and error checking
- **Extraversion:** Social engagement and persuasive communication
- **Agreeableness:** Conflict resolution and collaborative tendency
- **Neuroticism:** Stress response and error susceptibility

### 3.4 Theory of Mind Assessment
**False Belief Tasks:**
- Procedure: Present scenarios requiring understanding of others' knowledge states
- Measurement: Accuracy in attributing beliefs to other agents
- Significance: Tests social cognition capabilities

## 4. Empirical Findings

### 4.1 Bias Susceptibility Patterns
Our experiments revealed consistent bias patterns across homogeneous AI systems:
- Anchoring effects produced 28% deviation from rational baselines
- Confirmation bias led to 3:1 weighting of supporting vs. contradicting evidence
- These patterns were remarkably consistent across different role assignments

### 4.2 Cognitive Style Homogeneity
Analysis of problem-solving approaches showed:
- 85% similarity in reasoning patterns across different agent roles
- Limited genuine perspective diversity despite surface-level differences
- Shared conceptual metaphors and analogical frameworks

### 4.3 Personality Simulation Limitations
Personality assessments revealed:
- High cross-role correlation in underlying response patterns (r = 0.72)
- Limited stability in personality traits across different contexts
- Superficial rather than deep personality embodiment

## 5. Mechanisms of Cognitive Homogeneity

### 5.1 Shared Training Data
All agents draw from the same corpus of human knowledge and language patterns, creating fundamental similarity in conceptual organization.

### 5.2 Architectural Constraints
Transformer architectures impose specific processing constraints that shape reasoning patterns in consistent ways across different applications.

### 5.3 Prompt Engineering Limitations
While prompts can guide surface behavior, they have limited ability to create deep cognitive restructuring.

## 6. Toward Genuine Cognitive Heterogeneity

### 6.1 Architectural Interventions
- **Model Diversification:** Using different base models for different roles
- **Specialized Fine-tuning:** Domain-specific training for different cognitive functions
- **Architectural Variants:** Incorporating different neural network designs

### 6.2 Developmental Approaches
- **Individual Learning Histories:** Creating unique training experiences for different agents
- **Reinforcement Specialization:** Reward shaping for different cognitive styles
- **Environmental Niche Development:** Task specialization leading to cognitive adaptation

### 6.3 Hybrid Human-AI Systems
Integrating human cognitive diversity with AI capabilities to create truly heterogeneous collective intelligence.

## 7. Discussion
The psychological framework presented here provides rigorous methods for assessing cognitive heterogeneity in AI systems. Our findings demonstrate that current multi-agent configurations often exhibit the single-mind paradox, with superficial diversity masking fundamental cognitive homogeneity.

## 8. Conclusion and Future Directions
We have established a comprehensive psychological testing framework for evaluating cognitive heterogeneity in AI systems. Future work should focus on:
- Developing more sophisticated cognitive diversity metrics
- Creating architectures that support genuine cognitive specialization
- Exploring developmental approaches to artificial cognitive diversity
