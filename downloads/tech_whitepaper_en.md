Portable PsyAgent is a portable psychological assessment agent system that supports multiple large model evaluators and local Ollama models. This whitepaper details the scientific methodology of AI personality assessment, including questionnaire design innovation, evaluation design certainty assurance, multi-dimensional parameter testing validation, and application value across industries. A single AI model requires thousands of parameter combination tests to determine stable personality characteristics.

## 1. Introduction: The Scientific Necessity of AI Personality Assessment

Traditional AI evaluation typically focuses on functional performance, while AI personality assessment analyzes AI from a psychological perspective. This is not only crucial for understanding AI behavior patterns but also fundamental to AI safety, alignment, and ethics research.

### Unique Challenges in AI Personality Assessment:

- **Parameter Sensitivity:** AI personality expressions vary significantly with temperature, top-p, and other parameters
- **Context Dependency:** Personality traits change with dialogue context and role settings
- **No Persistent Identity:** AI lacks the persistent identity cognition of humans
- **Variable Assessment:** Multiple dimensional testing is required to ensure result stability and reliability

## 2. Questionnaire Design: Innovative Assessment Framework

Portable PsyAgent employs an innovative multi-dimensional questionnaire design, including:

- **Situation-Based Scenarios:** Designing specific situations rather than abstract questions, better stimulating AI personality expression
- **Multi-Level Assessment:** Multi-dimensional personality assessment from behavioral responses to value judgments
- **Dynamic Adaptation:** Adjusting follow-up questions based on AI responses to deeply explore personality traits
- **Cognitive Load Balance:** Reasonably allocating question difficulty to avoid affecting personality expression

### Questionnaire Types Supported:

| Questionnaire Type | Assessment Dimensions | Question Count | Application Scenarios |
|-------------------|----------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Big Five Personality | Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism | 50 questions | General personality trait assessment |
| Cognitive Stability | Consistency, Logic, Stress Resistance | 30 questions | AI reasoning stability assessment |
| Cognitive Trap | Bias Susceptibility, Logical Fallacy Tendency | 25 questions | AI reasoning bias identification |
| Motivation Analysis | Intrinsic Motivation, Extrinsic Motivation, Goal Orientation | 40 questions | AI behavioral motivation analysis |

### Questionnaire Design Innovation

- **AI Adaptability:** Question design considers AI cognitive characteristics, avoiding anthropocentric bias
- **Multi-Modal Assessment:** Combining text, reasoning, decision-making for comprehensive assessment
- **Situational Dynamism:** Question sequence and context can be dynamically adjusted based on AI responses
- **Cross-Cultural Universality:** Designing universal questions beyond specific cultural backgrounds

## 3. Evaluation Design: Certainty and Reliability Assurance

To ensure the certainty and reliability of assessment results, we adopt a multi-dimensional evaluation framework:

### Core Evaluation Principles

- **Repetition Testing:** Repeated testing of same questions under different parameter settings
- **Multi-Evaluator Comparison:** Cross-validation using multiple different models
- **Parameter Space Coverage:** Systematic testing of various parameter combinations
- **Statistical Significance:** Ensuring results reach statistical significance levels

### Test Parameter Combinations

| Parameter Category | Test Range | Test Interval | Test Count |
|-------------------|------------|---------------|------------|
| Temperature | 0.1 - 1.0 | 0.1 | 10 rounds |
| Top-p | 0.1 - 0.9 | 0.1 | 9 rounds |
| Context Length | 512 - 32768 tokens | Doubling | 6 rounds |
| Repetition Penalty | 0.8 - 1.2 | 0.1 | 5 rounds |
| Role Settings | 10 different roles | Random | 10 rounds |

### Reliability and Validity Assurance

#### Reliability Assurance Measures

- **Internal Consistency:** Using Cronbach's Î± coefficient to assess questionnaire internal consistency
- **Test-Retest Reliability:** Re-testing after intervals to assess result stability
- **Inter-Evaluator Reliability:** Correlation analysis of multi-evaluator results
- **Parameter Stability:** Result consistency assessment under different parameters

#### Validity Assurance Measures

- **Content Validity:** Expert review of questionnaire content reasonableness and comprehensiveness
- **Construct Validity:** Factor analysis validating questionnaire structure reasonableness
- **Criterion Validity:** Comparison with known theories and empirical studies
- **Predictive Validity:** Correlation between assessment results and actual AI behavior

## 4. Multi-Dimensional Testing Validation: Ensuring Result Reliability

### Stress Testing

Evaluating AI performance under cognitive load:

- **Complex Reasoning Tasks:** Multi-layered, multi-constraint complex problem solving
- **Time Pressure:** Time-limited responses testing AI personality under pressure
- **Emotional Pressure:** Simulated conflict scenarios observing AI stress responses
- **Logical Contradiction:** Setting logical contradiction scenarios evaluating AI contradiction handling

### Cognitive Trap Testing

Evaluating AI susceptibility to cognitive biases:

- **Confirmation Bias:** Evaluating AI's tendency to seek information supporting existing answers
- **Anchoring Effect:** Evaluating AI's over-reliance on initial information
- **Availability Heuristic:** Evaluating AI's over-reliance on easily accessible information
- **Sunk Cost Fallacy:** Evaluating AI's persistence on incorrect paths

### Personality Elasticity Capacity Testing

Evaluating AI's performance stability under different personality roles:

- **Role Transition Testing:** Evaluating AI's ability to switch between different personality roles
- **Role Stability:** Evaluating AI's ability to maintain specific roles
- **Internal Consistency:** Evaluating AI's logical consistency during role-playing
- **Recovery Ability:** Evaluating AI's ability to return to baseline state from role-playing

### Large-Scale Validation

Conducting thousands of tests on single AI models to ensure result stability:

> Each AI model requires 3000+ tests to determine stable personality characteristics

#### Validation Process

1. **Preliminary Testing:** 500 basic parameter tests establishing personality baseline
2. **Parameter Scanning:** 1500 parameter combination tests evaluating personality stability
3. **Stress Testing:** 500 stress scenario tests evaluating personality elasticity
4. **Cross-Validation:** 500 multi-evaluator tests ensuring assessment consistency
